Flip a coin 2 times. 
If the first coin flip is heads, answer honestly.
If the first coin flip is tails, answer according to the second coin flip (heads for yes, tails for no)!
Each person has a high degree of protection. Furthermore, we can recover the underlying statistics with some accuracy, as the "true statistics" are simply averaged with a 50% probability. Thus, if we collect a bunch of samples and it turns out that 60% of people answer yes, then we know that the TRUE distribution is actually centered around 70%, because 70% averaged wtih 50% (a coin flip) is 60% which is the result we obtained.
